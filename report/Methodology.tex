\section{Methodology}

Our framework will be developed using a number of tools and will also build
upon a few already developed and mature software libraries. Overall, we plan to
use the Python programming language, \gls{mpi} for cross process communication,
and \gls{cuda} for graphics computing.

\subsection{Python}

We will use Python because of its ease of development and plethora of existing
libraries, as we will mention further below.\\

Python also adds some advantages when it comes to usability when needing more
performance. That is, if we discover a need for certain aspects of the project
to be tuned and otherwise run faster, we can easily drop into C++ and write
sections of the program in a more native language.

\subsection{MPI}

We will use \gls{mpi} because it has established itself as the de-facto
interface for cross process communication [citation needed]. To allow for
interfacing with Python, we will use \texttt{mpi4py} because of its maturity
and implementation completeness.

\subsection{CUDA}

Further, we will be using \Gls{cuda} because of existing knowledge of the
framework and also because it is a well established framework for \gls{gpu}
computing.
