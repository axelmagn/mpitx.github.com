\section{Introduction}

Graphics processing units (GPU) have significantly altered the way
high-performance computing tasks can be performed today. A major challenge
remains in being able to seamlessly intergrate multiple workstations to further
parallelize the computational tasks. Current approaches provide the ability to
parallelize tasks, but they are less focused on optimally utillizing the varied
capabilities of heterogeneous graphics cards in the cluster of workstations.\\
