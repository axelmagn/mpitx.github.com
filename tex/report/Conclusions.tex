\section{Conclusions}

We have developed some baseline test solutions to a few problems. From the
baseline solutions, we can easily tell there are significant performance
increases from parallelizing code. However, there is still a complexity cost.
The goal of \texttt{OpenCUDA+MPI} is to limit this complexity cost and from our
really early versions of the framework, the outlook of being able to do just
that looks very good.

\subsection{Future Work}

Work is continuing to progress on the development of the framework, but an
early alpha version is nearly complete. As we continue to develop the
framework, there are a few objectives we would like to achieve. Namely, we
would like to add better debugging and profiling functionality, expose
\gls{cuda} device initialization to the user, and finish node configuration and
administrative tasks.
