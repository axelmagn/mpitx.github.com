\subsection{Vector Summation}

Our first developed test program was a $ 10 $ billion element wise vector
summation problem. This is a simple and, as we will see, a bad example of using
a cluster to speed up the computational time required. Although we did see an
increase in performance, the cost of \gls{io} far out weighs the benefit.
Specifically, to do the computation on one machine (one \gls{cpu}), it took a
\gls{wall_time} of $254$ seconds (about $4$ minutes) and a \gls{cpu_time} of
$13.7$ seconds.  Further, to do the computation using a single \gls{gpu} took
about $4172$ seconds (\gls{wall_time}) or about $70$ minutes, $13.83$ seconds
(\gls{cpu_time}) while the computing the summation of the cluster took about
$3177$ seconds (\gls{wall_time}) or about $50$ minutes, $10.51$ seconds
(\gls{cpu_time}). Our \gls{cpu} only implementation took the least amount of
elapsed time, it took the second longest \gls{cpu_time}. Our \gls{cuda} only
implementation took the longest in both \gls{wall_time} and \gls{cpu_time} and
our cluster implementation was shortest \gls{cpu_time} but seconds longest
elapsed time. The benefit of saving an upwards of $3.3$ seconds is not worth
the extra incurred cost of $2923$ seconds. Not so surprisingly though, running
the vector summation problem over the cluster \emph{without} using \gls{cuda}
does increase the overall elapsed time of the problem; namely, it took $226$
seconds \gls{wall_time} (currently the correct \gls{cpu_time} is unable to be
collected). Further, increasing the number of nodes part of the program's pool,
decreases the \gls{wall_time} for each node.

\subsection{N-Body Problem}

We have several sizes of the \texttt{N-Body} problem that we tested with:
$2,001$ particles, $20,000$ particles, $200,000$ particles, $2,000,000$, and
$20,000,000$ particles.\\

The computational times are for only one time step. The method for computing
the gravitational potential is an adaptation of the \gls{p3m} method. The
benefit of using this method is we are able to nicely distribute the problem
over the \gls{cluster} and / or over a \gls{gpu} (because of memory
limitations) while maintaining a respectable accuracy for close body
interactions. Further, if a grid contains more bodies than a specified
threshold (in our case $200,000$), we can further sub-divide the grid to
improve performance and maintain accuracy still.\\

There are other algorithms for computing \texttt{N-Body} problems on the
\gls{cpu} that are quite efficient, notably, the Barnes-Hut Tree
algorithm\cite{barneshut1986}; however, using it would distort and confound the
comparisons between \gls{cpu}, \gls{gpu}, and \gls{cluster} implementations,
not to mention the complexities of implementing such an algorithm on
\glspl{gpu} and over a \gls{cluster}.

\subsubsection{N-Body --- CPU}

In \gls{cpu} tests, we were only able to complete several of the problem sizes;
the larger sizes are infeasible. Notably, the smaller sizes were computed in a
relatively respectable amount of time. While the bigger sizes were time
consuming, not even attempted, or aborted. For example, the 2 million body
problem was aborted after running for about 2 weeks.

\subsubsection{N-Body --- GPU}

As noted above, the \gls{gpu} (\gls{cuda}) implementation uses the same
computational method (\gls{p3m}). Using the \gls{gpu}, we were able to compute
the $ 20,000,000 $ size problem and may be able to compute larger sets within a
\emph{reasonable} amount of time. See \cref{tab:gpu_nbody} for a breakdown of
the running times.

\subsubsection{N-Body --- 16 Node Cluster}

Similar to the other solutions, we are still using the \gls{p3m} method for
computing a single time step of the N-Body problem. Over 16 nodes, we were able
to see drastic improvements over \gls{cpu} and \gls{cuda} implementations.
Notably, in the $20,000$ problem size, the \gls{cluster} did nearly $19044\%$
better than the \gls{cpu} and about $115\%$ better than a single \gls{gpu}.
Further, in the $200,000$ problem size, we see the \gls{cluster} did about
$535,743\%$ better versus \gls{cpu} and about $148\%$ better versus \gls{gpu}.
See \cref{tab:cudampi_nbody} for times of each problem size.
