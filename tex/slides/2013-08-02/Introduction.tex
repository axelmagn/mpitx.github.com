\begin{block}{\Large Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
\item{Scientific applications require a large number of floating point number
operations}
\item{Two main ways of processing: \emph{serial} and \emph{parallel}}
\item{Graphics Processing Units (GPU's) are increasingly being used for general
purpose computation because of their unique ability tO do many parallel
floating point calculations}
\item{Distributing GPU work over many computers can show even greater
performance improvements}
\item{The development required is \emph{very} expensive}
\end{itemize}
