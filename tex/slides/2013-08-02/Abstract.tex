\begin{block}{\Large Abstract}
The introduction and rise of General Purpose Graphics Computing has
significantly impacted parallel and high-performance computing. It has
introduced challenges when it comes to distributed computing with GPUs. Current
solutions target specifics: specific hardware, specific network topology, a
specific level of processing. Those restrictions on GPU computing limit
scientists and researchers in various ways. The goal of OpenCUDA+MPI project is
to develop a framework that allows researchers and scientists to write a
general algorithm without the overhead of worrying about the specifics of the
hardware and the cluster it will run against while taking full advantage of
parallel and distributed computing on GPUs. As work toward the solution
continues to progress, we have proven the need for the framework and expect to
find the framework enables scientists to focus on their research.
