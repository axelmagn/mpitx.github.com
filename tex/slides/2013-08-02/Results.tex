\begin{block}{\Large Results}
We were able to show that distributing work over a cluster can
significanly decrease the amount of time required for a problem. For example,
processing the N-Body problem for 200 thousand bodies on a single CPU required
$114349$ seconds (about 31 hours), as compared to a single GPU which required
$52$ seconds and distributing over 16 GPU's only took $21$ seconds. For more
comparisons, please see the table below. [Currently, a comparison between the
distributed code with and without the framework is not available.]\hfill{}\\{}

Although biased, it was interesting to notice the development time difference
between writing the distributed code without the framework as compared to with
the framework. Namely, without the framework, it required several weeks,
whereas, with the framework, it required less than a week.
