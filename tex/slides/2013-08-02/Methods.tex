\begin{block}{\Large Methodology}
To fully understand the purpose of creating a framework, we first set out to
attempt developing parallel code \emph{without} our proposed framework.

We also want to not only compare times of development speed, but actual running
time of each solution. As such, we developed a CPU only, a single GPU, and a
distributed GPU solution to the N-Body problem and compared running times of
each for several different problem sizes.\hfill{}\\{}

The N-Body problem was chosen as a test problem because it is \emph{not}
an embarassingly parallel problem and, as such, requires inter-communication.
